# React Quiz - Data Fetcher Component

## Overview

Build a React component that fetches data from an API and handles loading, success, and error states. You will work in `DataFetcher.jsx` where TODOs guide you through each step.

## How to Run

```bash
cd test-react
npm install
```

### Run tests
```bash
make run-test
```

All 5 tests must pass.

### Run dev server
To view the component in the browser:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:5173/ to see the component in action.
